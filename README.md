# WildBind

WildBind is a dynamic and programmable key binding framework for number pads.

Features:

- It supports X11 desktop environments.
- It binds any action to number pad keys.
- Key bindings are written in Haskell (actually, it's just a bunch of Haskell modules).
- Key bindings can be **dynamic**, i.e. you can use different key bindings for different active windows.
- Key bindings can be **stateful**, e.g. you can bind actions to **sequences** of keys.
